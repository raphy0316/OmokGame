 Omok(connect6), a traditional Korean game, implemented in Java

Connect6 is a two-player board game played on a 19x19 grid. The objective of the game is to connect six stones of your color horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Here are the basic rules:
<br>
Game Board:<br>
The game is played on a 19x19 grid.<br>
<br>
Players:<br>
Two players participate, each using a different color of stones (typically black and white).<br>
<br>
Objective:<br>
The goal is to form a straight line of six stones of your color either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.<br>
<br>
Turns:<br>
Players take turns placing one stone of their color on an empty intersection of the grid.<br>
<br>
Winning:<br>
The game ends when a player successfully connects six stones in a row. The connection can be made horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.<br>
<br>
Overlines:<br>
Forming a line of more than six stones is not allowed. A player wins as soon as they have a line of six stones, and any subsequent stones in that line do not count.<br>
<br>
Draw:<br>
If the entire board is filled and no player has connected six stones, the game is a draw.<br>
Game End:<br>
The game concludes when a player wins by connecting six stones or when a draw is declared.<br>
<br>
Connect6 requires strategic thinking, as players aim to create connections while also blocking their opponent from achieving the same. The game combines elements of pattern recognition, tactical placement, and long-term planning.
